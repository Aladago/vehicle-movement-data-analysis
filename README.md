## Repository Details
The repository contains code which was submitted for a career fair competition at Ashesi University College in 2017. The competition is a university wide programming competition organized annually by the computer science department of the university. 
The competition involved analyzing real data gathered from the movement of the university's buses and responding to some questions. 
The tasks, instructions and descriptions of the competition can be found in the file _2017 Ashesi Career Fair Programming Competition.pdf_. The .csv files contain the required data. Finally, repository contains a 1-page report of the implementation. All files are implemented in Java
